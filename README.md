# Temporary Exposure Key Export scraper

:warning: Please note:
* :bug: In [February 2021 the service started to include data from other countries](https://slovenia.representation.ec.europa.eu/novice-dogodki/novice-0/aplikacija-ostanizdrav-tudi-cez-mejo-2021-02-12_sl), so it became less important indicator of local Covid spread (see ðŸ“ˆ the big jump in the chart)
* ðŸ’€ In April 2022 the services access was unexpectedly limited to some (foreign?) IPs, breaking the access to GitHub workflow servers, which were [performing the :robot: scraping](https://github.com/sledilnik/cwa-scrape/actions/workflows/make.yml), breaking the time series (see ðŸ“‰ the last drop to 0 in the chart). 
* :coffin: Finally the [#OstaniZdrav application and all related services were stopped on 2023-03-31](https://www.gov.si/novice/2023-03-30-prenehanje-delovanja-aplikacije-ostanizdrav/), so the code in this repository became unused and unmaintained.
* :file_cabinet: Repository was **archived on 2023-08-19**. You can still fork it or we can un-archive it if needed later on.
* :floppy_disk: Data can also be found on:
  * [sledilnik/data/ostanizdrav](https://github.com/sledilnik/data/tree/master/ostanizdrav) and
  * [:slovenia: government's OpenData portal](https://podatki.gov.si/dataset/statisticni-podatki-aplikacije-ostanizdrav).

After scraping all the data, it aggregates some statistics into [keycount.csv](data/SI/keycount.csv) and [.json](data/SI/keycount.json), which is then plotted onto the [keycount.png](data/SI/keycount.png) chart:
